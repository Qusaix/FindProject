## Journey
The idea behind the app becomes to me after I see a lot of  Trainers struggle with work in something they love and make a living and the same thing for the trainees they need a good Trainers to help them reach their goal. in this application, I'm trying to solve this throw connect these tow in one place and offer them everything they need.

## Motivation
The Motivation behind this project is to help Trainers Work in something they love without caring about advertising their self on social media or anything else just focusing on helping there Trainees.
